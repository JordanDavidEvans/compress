# compress

A static WebP compression site ready for offline or zip-and-serve hosting. Drop or select multiple images and the browser converts them to WebP at 97% quality, scaling resolution in steps until they land under your target size (500KB by default).

## Usage
1. Open `src/index.html` locally or host the contents of the `src/` folder as-is.
2. Adjust the target size slider if you need something other than 500KB.
3. Drag and drop or click to select multiple images—the compression starts instantly.
4. Download the resulting WebP files once the progress cards show "Compression ready."

All processing happens in your browser; no images are uploaded to any server.

## Repository layout
- `src/index.html` – main static experience.
- `src/styles.css` – extracted styles for the UI.
- `src/app.js` – browser-only compression logic.
- `dist/` – build output generated by `npm run build` (not committed).
- `package.json` – minimal build scripts for copying static files.

## Local development
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Build the static assets: `npm run build` (copies `src` to `dist`).
3. Zip the `dist/` folder to move the site anywhere you like, or open `dist/index.html` directly in your browser.
